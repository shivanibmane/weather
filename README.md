My Approach to Building the Weather App
Before starting the project, I carefully read the assignment instructions. Then, I referred to the WeatherAPI and OpenWeatherAPI documentation to understand how to fetch weather data.
Steps Followed:
1. Read API Documentation – Understood how to fetch weather data.
2. Set Up React App – Created a React app using Vite.
3. Designed the UI – Built a simple and user-friendly interface.
4. Installed Axios – Used npm install axios to simplify API requests.
5. Generated API Key – Created an API key and integrated it into the app.
6. Fetched & Displayed Data – Made API calls and displayed the weather data dynamically.
7. Handled Errors – Implemented error handling using try/catch to manage cases where a city or location is not found.
8. Pushed to GitHub – Uploaded the project repository to GitHub.
9. Deployed on Vercel – Deployed the project to Vercel for public access.
10. Most of my time was spent on figuring out how to make API calls and display data properly. Additionally, I focused on handling errors effectively to ensure a smooth user experience.
